# Social Networking API with MongoDB

This project implements a RESTful API for a basic social networking application using Node.js and MongoDB. It supports user profiles, posts, and the ability to follow other users.

## Features

- **User Profiles:** Create, update, view, and delete user profiles with details like username, bio, and profile picture URL. Use UUID for user IDs.
- **Authentication:** Implement JWT-based authentication for signing up, logging in, and performing actions on user profiles.
- **Posts:** Allow users to create, view, update, and delete their posts. Each post includes text content, a timestamp, and the ID of the user who created it.
- **Following Mechanism:** Enable users to follow and unfollow other users. Provide endpoints to retrieve the list of users a user is following and who is following them.
- **Efficient Data Retrieval:** Use MongoDB's aggregation framework to implement efficient queries for the social feed, displaying posts from users that a given user follows, sorted by most recent.
- **Data Modeling:** Design MongoDB schemas for users, posts, and follows. Consider references or embedded documents for optimal performance.
- **Security and Validation:** Implement input validation to prevent injection attacks and rate limiting to protect against brute force attacks.
- **Testing:** Write integration tests to ensure API endpoints work as expected and handle errors gracefully.
- **Documentation:** Provide comprehensive API documentation detailing endpoint descriptions, request/response formats, and example use cases.
